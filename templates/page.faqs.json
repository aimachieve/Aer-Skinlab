This ensures that you receive the best results. It’s always good and recommended to have a light snack before your procedure to avoid getting light headed. If you do experience this, we will always provide you with water, juice, or something sweet to bring the blood sugar back up to ensure your comfort. <br\/><br\/><strong>Please refrain from alcohol the night before and 24 hours post treatment, as it may lead to more bruising and swelling. <\/strong><br\/><br\/>Depending on the treatment, we may recommend taking an aspirin 1 hour before, to ensure extra comfort. We do offer topical numbing cream before certain procedures as well. Pre care will always be explained thoroughly by our knowledgeable team so we make sure you are well prepared.<\/p>"

With first time consultations, we do require a deposit that will be used towards your treatment with us. <br\/><br\/>Depending on the treatment providers schedule, we may be able to get you booked in for a consultation on that day. If we do not have the space, we will make sure it happens at our earliest convenience. We are always here and available to help you out with any skincare recommendations and introduce you to our very own AE.R Skin line.<\/p>"
